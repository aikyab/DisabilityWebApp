                <p>If you need recommendations, think carefully about who to ask.  Make sure that you ask people who think highly of you.  Some ideas for people to ask might be: sports coaches, teachers, school counselors, club or activity sponsors.</p>
                <p>f you need to answer an essay question, plan out your answer ahead of time.  Check what the question is, and come back and complete it when you have planned out your answer.</p>

                    <p>After you apply you have to wait to hear back from the schools you applied to.  Waiting to hear back can be stressful, but it can also be exciting.  Think about all your options.  Make a list to help you make decisions once you hear back.  If you got accepted to all the schools you 
                        applied to, which would you want to go to?  Rank all your choices in order of which you wantto go to the most.</p>
                    <p>When you get your decisions back, itâ€™s decision time.  Look at the list you made, and decide, of all the schools you got into, which is the best fit for you?  Look at all the factors.  Location, programs, cost, and disability services.  You can only accept one offer, so be thoughtful in making the best decision for yourself.</p>
